## How to Run Locally

So you'd like to give this project a spin? You've in luck, follow these
instructions for success! To start, you'll need to obtain the following:

* **Python** (version 3 or greater)
  * https://www.python.org/downloads/
* **Django** (version 1.9 or greater)
  * See below for installation.
* **Text Editor** (or **IDE**, *PyCharm* is worth a try ;) )
  * https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

After successfully installing Python and/or your Text Editor/IDE, launch
a terminal window and install Django with the following command:

```
    pip install Django==1.9.7
```

Next, `cd` into the `plantalytics-backend/src` directory and run the
following command:

```
    python manage.py runserver
```

Once the development server is up and running, launch a web browser
and go to the following URL:

* http://localhost:8000/dummy/

If successful, you should see the following message:

* *Hello , Plantalytics World!! Welcome to the backend, where things ain't pretty, but they get stuff DONE!*

**Did you see it? Congrats!! You're a *backend dev* now!**
